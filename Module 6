Here is the code for assignment #6:

A <- matrix(c(2, 0, 1, 3), ncol = 2)
B <- matrix(c(5, 2, 4, -1), ncol = 2)
result <- A + B
print(result)

[,1] [,2]
[1,]    7    5
[2,]    2    2

result <- A - B
print(result)
 [,1] [,2]
[1,]   -3   -3
[2,]   -2    4

to make a diagonal matrix:
 c <- diag(c(4, 1, 2, 3))
print(c)
 [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,]    4    0    0    0
[2,]    0    1    0    0
[3,]    0    0    2    0
[4,]    0    0    0    3
And lastly, how to create the matrix given to us in the assignment using the diag() function:

D <- diag(3, 5, 5)
#fill matrix with 1's
D[1, ] <- 1
#replace with 3?
D[1,1] <- 3
D[ ,1] <- 2
print(D)

Discussion: the matrices have to be identified in R as "A" and "B". In order to add or subtract them, you can use the + or - operation function and then "print": the results (shown above). 
To create a matrix with the values 4, 1, 2, 3 in diagonal, the diag() function can be used. The results show that it is a matrix of 4 because the results show a matrix with 4 columns and 4 rows (even though nrow or ncol was not specified in the code).

Lastly, and the trickiest one is to create code for a matrix using the diag() function to get the matrix given to us in the assignment. Matrix "D" is specified to get diagonal values of 3 and nrow = 5 and ncol = 5. I wasn't sure how to input the 2's and 1's within the same code so I coded for Matrix D to have the first row replaced with 1's and then another separate code for the first column to have 2's added in. The print(D) function finalizes the matrix.
