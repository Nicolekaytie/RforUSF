> myMean <- function(assignment2){return(sum(assignment2)/length(assignment2))}
This is what I get on Rstudio when I test the myMean function. I think the code does not work because it is not written properly. I'm not sure if I needed to install a package in order for the myMean function to already be integrated into Rstudio, but if not; the function seems like it is not defined properly from what I understand about R so far. The data for "assignment2" code is written properly.
The code for the function is potentially written improperly because of the "return" portion. It is my understanding that a variable be used when using "return". If the variable is not properly defined, anything that occurs after the "return function" will not be run. In this case, the myMean function is not defined until after the "return function" and therefore, myMean is not clearly defined for the Rstudio program. This is my best guess.
